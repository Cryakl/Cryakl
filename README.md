<b>Where can I reach you?</b><br>
You can quickly reach me on Telegram: https://t.me/Cryakl<br>
You can also open an issue on my repo(s) if you need anything.<br>
Beware of impersonators, I do not sell/upload anything.<br>

<b>Is (Insert thing here) safe?</b><br>
I have tested everything in a VM beforehand, though I am not perfect.<br>
Obviously, you should <b>NEVER</b> run anything on a machine you care about.<br>
Online sandboxes I recommend for testing are <a href="https://app.any.run">ANY.RUN</a>, <a href="https://tria.ge">Triage</a> & <a href="https://analyze.intezer.com">Intezer</a>.<br>
