# Welcome to my profile!

<b>What do you do?</b>  
I am a collector and archiver of programs/software.  
My interests are Malware and Programming for fun.  
Recently I am getting into reverse engineering.  
  
<b>Where can I reach you?</b>  
Open an issue on my repository if you need anything.  
Beware of impersonators, I do not sell anything.  
  
<b>Is (Repository) safe?</b>  
I have tested everything beforehand, though I am not perfect.  
Generally, it is safe. If suspicious, use a VM or Sandboxie.  
Online sandboxes I recommend for this are <a href="https://app.any.run">ANY.RUN</a> & <a href="https://tria.ge">Triage</a>.
