<b>What do you do?</b><br>  
I like to collect and archive programs/software, mainly malware.<br>
My interests are malware research and programming for fun.<br>
I'm also into reverse engineering, though I suck at it.<br>

<br>
<b>Where can I reach you?</b><br>
You can open an issue on my repo(s) if you need anything.<br>
You can also contact me on Telegram at <a href="https://t.me/Cryakl">@Cryakl</a> if needed.<br>
There are no other points of contact or social media I own.<br>
</p>

<br>
<b>Can I buy things off of you or donate to you?</b><br>
No, I do not sell anything, neither do I accept donations.<br>
If anyone claiming to be me does that, then they are a scammer.<br>
All my work is out of purely archival and research purposes only.<br>
</p>

<br>
<b>Can I redistribute or use your work however I want?</b><br>
Yes, I do not need any form of credit even if that would be nice.<br>
I only ask that you don't use my work for malicious purposes.<br>
So basically, yeah you can, just do it with good faith.<br>

<b>Is (Insert thing here) safe?</b><br>
I have tested everything in a VM beforehand, though I am not perfect.<br>
Obviously, you should <b>NEVER</b> run anything on a machine you care about.<br>
Online sandboxes I recommend for testing are <a href="https://app.any.run">ANY.RUN</a>, <a href="https://tria.ge">Triage</a> & <a href="https://analyze.intezer.com">Intezer</a>.<br>
