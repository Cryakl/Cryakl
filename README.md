<b>What do you do?</b><br>  
I am a collector and archiver of programs/software.<br>
My interests are Malware and Programming for fun.<br>
Recently I am getting into reverse engineering.<br>

<br>
<b>Where can I reach you?</b><br>
Open an issue on my repository if you need anything.<br>
Beware of impersonators, I do not sell anything.<br>
You can only verify it's me by making me write something here.<br>

<br>
<b>Is (Repository) safe?</b><br>
I have tested everything beforehand, though I am not perfect.<br>
Generally, it is safe. If suspicious, use a VM or Sandboxie.<br>
Online sandboxes I recommend for this are <a href="https://app.any.run">ANY.RUN</a>, <a href="https://tria.ge">Triage</a> & <a href="https://analyze.intezer.com">Intezer</a>.<br>
